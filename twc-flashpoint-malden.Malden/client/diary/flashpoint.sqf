In TWC Flashpoint you are to capture the island from hostiles that will reinforce themselves, attempt to recapture zones, and patrol around. The general goal is to make a more enjoyable domination experience where enemies do not just wait to be killed. You also have to balance civilian opinions or else flashpoint is going to turn into an insurgency."]];
